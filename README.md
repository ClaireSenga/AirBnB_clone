0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Group project
Python
OOP

Project Description:

	This project is about building an AirBnB console. The console works in such a way that it imitates the GUI like App, except it doesn't have any design or a frisky look. Look at it as a CLI App where everything is happening under the hood. The Console itself is like a shell terminal that takes in commands for various outputs like fetching database of the models etc.
A lot of things are happening under the hood in this project, like the inheritance of the models, polymorphism, database, serialization and deserialization etc.
This project challenges our knowledge on Python's OOP.
